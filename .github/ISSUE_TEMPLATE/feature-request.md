**NOTES**
*************************************************************************************
* Adjust and remove unneeded text in this report. Especially all these sections that 
are Optional. You can also add section if it's needed. Just keep in mind to keep the 
same layout as the rest.
* This paragraph (Starting from the long * line before the "Notes" up to the end of 
this file) for example should also be removed from this report before sending the 
issue.
* You can always edit your report or comments. Don't hesitate, we even encourage you
to correct your typo's or rephrase some paragraphs. Or even to add some more 
information. We just would ask to add an `[UPDATE]` paragraph on the end of the report 
or comment. You should be also aware of the file history. We can track back changes 
applied in reports and comments.
